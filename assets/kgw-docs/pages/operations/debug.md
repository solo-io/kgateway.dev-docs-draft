Use built-in tools to troubleshoot issues in your {{< reuse "/kgw-docs/snippets/kgateway.md" >}} setup.

{{< reuse "/kgw-docs/snippets/kgateway-capital.md" >}} consists of the control plane and an {{< reuse "/kgw-docs/snippets/data-plane.md" >}} data plane. If you experience issues in your environment, such as policies that are not applied or traffic that is not routed correctly, in a lot of cases, these errors can be observed at the proxy.

## Debug the control plane {#control-plane}

1. Enable port-forwarding on the control plane.

   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward deploy/{{< reuse "/kgw-docs/snippets/helm-kgateway.md" >}} -n {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} 9095
   ```

2. In your browser, open the admin server debugging interface: [http://localhost:9095/](http://localhost:9095/).

   {{< reuse-image src="img/admin-server-debug-ui.png" caption="Figure: Admin server debugging interface.">}}
   {{< reuse-image-dark srcDark="img/admin-server-debug-ui.png" caption="Figure: Admin server debugging interface.">}}

3. Select one of the endpoints to continue debugging. {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/review-table.md" >}} 

   | Endpoint | Description |
   | -- | -- |
   | `/debug/pprof` | View the pprof profile of the control plane. A profile shows you the stack traces of the call sequences, such as Go routines, that led to particular events, such as memory allocation. The endpoint includes descriptions of each available profile.|
   | `/logging` | Review the current logging levels of each component in the control plane. You can also interactively set the log level by component, such as to enable `DEBUG` logs. |
   | `/snapshots/krt` | View the current krt snapshot, or the point-in-time view of the transformed Kubernetes resources and their sync status that the control plane processed. These resources are then used to generate gateway configuration that is sent to the gateway proxies for routing decisions. |
   | `/snapshots/xds` | View the current xDS snapshot, or the Envoy-specific configuration (such as Listeners, Routes, Backends, and Workloads) that is being sent to and applied by Envoy gateway proxies. These snapshots show the final translated configuration that Envoy gateway proxies use for routing decisions. For snapshots to be present, you must have a Gateway resource that creates a connected, Envoy-based kgateway proxy. | 

{{< version exclude-if="2.4.x,2.3.x,2.2.x,2.1.x" >}}
If the control plane pod does not start after you set `KGW_VALIDATOR_MODE`, review the control plane logs before you use the admin server. The valid values are `CACHE` and `BINARY`. An empty value or any other value prevents the control plane from starting, and the logs include `invalid validator mode`.

```sh
kubectl logs deploy/{{< reuse "/kgw-docs/snippets/helm-kgateway.md" >}} -n {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
```
{{< /version >}}

## Debug your gateway setup

{{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/debug-gateway.md" >}}

## Set gateway proxy debug logging {#gateway-debug-logging}

You can set the log level for the Envoy proxy to get more detailed logs. Envoy log level options include `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `critical`, and `off`. The default log level is `info`. For more information, see [Debugging Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/quick-start/run-envoy#debugging-envoy).

1. Create a {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/gatewayparameters.md" >}} resource to add any custom settings to the gateway. For other settings, see the [{{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/gatewayparameters.md" >}} API docs]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/api/#gatewayparametersspec" >}}) or check out the [Gateway customization guides](../../setup/customize/).
   
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/gatewayparam-apiversion.md" >}}
   kind: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/gatewayparameters.md" >}}
   metadata:
     name: debug-gateway
     namespace: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     kube: 
       envoyContainer:
         bootstrap:
           logLevel: debug
   EOF
   ```

2. Create a Gateway resource that references your custom {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/gatewayparameters.md" >}}. 
   
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   kind: Gateway
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: debug-gateway
     namespace: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     gatewayClassName: {{< reuse "/kgw-docs/snippets/gatewayclass.md" >}}
     infrastructure:
       parametersRef:
         name: debug-gateway
         group: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/gatewayparam-group.md" >}}
         kind: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/gatewayparameters.md" >}}      
     listeners:
     - protocol: HTTP
       port: 8080
       name: http
       allowedRoutes:
         namespaces:
           from: All
   EOF
   ```

3. Verify that a pod is created for your gateway proxy and that it has the pod settings that you defined in the {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/gatewayparameters.md" >}} resource. 
   
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=debug-gateway -n {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} -o yaml
   ```

4. Create an HTTPRoute that routes traffic to your app through the debug gateway. The following example assumes that you set up the [sample `httpbin` app]({{< link-hextra path="/install/sample-app/" >}}).

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     parentRefs:
       - name: debug-gateway
         namespace: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
     hostnames:
       - "debug.com"
     rules:
       - backendRefs:
           - name: httpbin
             port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

5. Get the address of the debug gateway proxy.

   * **Cloud Provider LoadBalancer**
     ```sh
     export INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get svc -n {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} debug-gateway -o=jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0]['hostname','ip']}")
     echo $INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS
     ```
   
   * **Port-forward for local testing**
     ```sh
     kubectl port-forward deployment/debug-gateway -n {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} 8080:8080
     ```

6. Send traffic through the debug gateway proxy.

   * **Cloud Provider LoadBalancer**
     ```sh
     curl -i http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/headers -H "host: debug.com:8080"
     ```
   * **Port-forward for local testing**
     ```sh
     curl -i localhost:8080/headers -H "host: debug.com"
     ```

7. Review the debug logs for the gateway proxy.

   ```sh
   kubectl logs -n {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} -l app.kubernetes.io/name=debug-gateway
   ```

   Example output:

   ```console

   ```

## Policy not applied {#trafficpolicy}

As part of debugging, you might have noticed that your HTTPRoute or Gateway had an attached {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}. The {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}'s status might say `Accepted` and seem normal. However, when you checked the gateway configuration, the policy is not applied to the selected routes. Review the following common reasons for missing policies.

1. Verify that the {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} is attached correctly. For example, you might use label selectors that do not match any HTTPRoute or Gateway. For more information, see [Policy attachment](../../about/policies/trafficpolicy/#policy-attachment-trafficpolicy).

2. Confirm that you do not have multiple, conflicting policies. In general, the oldest policy is enforced. For more information, see [Policy priority and merging rules](../../about/policies/trafficpolicy/#policy-priority-and-merging-rules).

3. Determine if you need a [Kubernetes ReferenceGrant](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/api-types/referencegrant/). For example, the {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} might rely on a GatewayExtension to enable a feature such as external auth. However, the GatewayExtension might be in a different namespace than the backing external auth service.

   Example ReferenceGrant for external auth GatewayExtension:

   * The GrantExtension for external auth, HTTPRoute, and backing Service are in the app namespace, such as `httpbin`.
   * The external auth service is in the `{{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}` namespace.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: ReferenceGrant
   metadata:
     name: reference-grant
     namespace: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     from:
       - group: gateway.kgateway.dev
         kind: GatewayExtension
         namespace: httpbin
     to:
       - group: ""
         kind: Service
   ```


<!-- TODO: CLI
## Before you begin

If you have not done yet, install the `{{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` CLI. The `{{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` CLI is a convenient tool that helps you gather important information about your gateway proxy. To install the `{{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}`, you run the following command: 
```sh
curl -sL https://run.solo.io/gloo/install | sh
export PATH=$HOME/.gloo/bin:$PATH
```

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to use the version of `{{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}}` that matches your installed version.

-->

<!-- TODO: CLI
5. Check the proxy configuration that is served by the kgateway xDS server. When you create kgateway resources, these resources are translated into Envoy configuration and sent to the xDS server. If kgateway resources are configured correctly, the configuration must be included in the proxy configuration that is served by the xDS server. 
   ```sh
   {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}} proxy served-config --name http
   ```

6. Review the logs for each component. Each component logs the sync loops that it runs, such as syncing with various environment signals like the Kubernetes API. You can fetch the latest logs for all the components with the following command. 
   ```bash
   {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}} debug logs
   # save the logs to a file
   {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}} debug logs -f gloo.log
   # only print errors
   {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}} debug logs --errors-only
   ```
   
   You can use the `kubectl logs` command to view logs for individual components. 
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f -n {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} -l kgateway=kgateway
   ```

   To follow the logs of other kgateway components, simply change the value of the `gloo` label as shown in the table below.

   | Component | Command |
   | ------------- | ------------- |
   | Gloo control plane | `kubectl logs -f -n {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} -l kgateway=kgateway` |
   | kgateway proxy | `kubectl logs -f -n {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} -l gloo=kube-gateway` |
   | Redis | `kubectl logs -f -n {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}} -l gloo=redis` |

7. If you still cannot troubleshoot the issue, capture the logs and the state of kgateway in a file. 
   ```bash
   {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}} debug logs -f gloo-logs.log
   {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/cli-name.md" >}} debug yaml -f gloo-yamls.yaml
   ```
