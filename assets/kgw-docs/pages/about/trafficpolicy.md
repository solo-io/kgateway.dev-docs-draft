Use a {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} resource to attach policies to one, multiple, or all routes in an HTTPRoute resource, or all the routes that a Gateway serves. 

## Policy attachment {#policy-attachment-trafficpolicy}

You can apply {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicies.md" >}} to all routes in an HTTPRoute resource or only to specific routes. 

{{< version exclude-if="2.1.x,2.2.x,2.3.x" >}}
Policies can attach to Gateway listeners, ListenerSets, or routes whose parents share a port. Policy status reports the specific listener, ListenerSet, or route parent that the policy targets.
{{< /version >}}

{{< version exclude-if="2.0.x" >}}
> [!NOTE]
> By default, you must attach policies to resources that are in the same namespace. To create global policies that can attach to resources in any namespace, see the [Global policy attachment](../global-attachment/) guide.
{{< /version >}}

### All HTTPRoute routes {#attach-to-all-routes}

You can use the `spec.targetRefs` section in the {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} resource to apply policies to all the routes that are specified in a particular HTTPRoute resource. 

The following example {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} resource specifies transformation rules that are applied to all routes in the `httpbin` HTTPRoute resource. 

```yaml {hl_lines=[7,8,9,10]}
apiVersion: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy-apiversion.md" >}}
kind: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}
metadata:
  name: transformation
  namespace: httpbin
spec:
  targetRefs: 
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: httpbin
  transformation:
    response:
      set:
      - name: x-kgateway-response
        value: '{{ request_header("x-kgateway-request") }}' 
```

You can also apply the same {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} to multiple HTTPRoutes by referencing them in the `targetRefs` section, as shown in the following example. 

```yaml {hl_lines=[7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]}
apiVersion: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy-apiversion.md" >}}
kind: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}
metadata:
  name: transformation
  namespace: httpbin
spec:
  targetRefs: 
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: httpbin
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: petstore
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: echo
  transformation:
    response:
      set:
      - name: x-kgateway-response
        value: '{{ request_header("x-kgateway-request") }}' 
```


### Individual route {#attach-to-route}

Instead of applying the policy to all routes that are defined in an HTTPRoute resource, you can apply them to specific routes by using the `ExtensionRef` filter in the HTTPRoute resource. 

> [!WARNING]
> Attaching a policy via the `ExtensionRef` filter is legacy behavior and might be deprecated in a future release. Instead, use the [HTTPRoute rule attachment option](#attach-to-rule) to apply a policy to an individual route, which requires the Kubernetes Gateway API experimental channel version 1.3.0 or later.

The following example shows a {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} resource that defines a transformation rule. Note that the `spec.targetRefs` field is not set. Because of that, the {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} does not apply until it is referenced in an HTTPRoute by using the `ExtensionRef` filter. 

```yaml
apiVersion: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy-apiversion.md" >}}
kind: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}
metadata:
  name: transformation
  namespace: httpbin
spec:
  transformation:
    response:
      set:
      - name: x-kgateway-response
        value: '{{ request_header("x-kgateway-request") }}' 
```

To apply the policy to a particular route, you use the `ExtensionRef` filter on the desired HTTPRoute route. In the following example, the {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} is applied to the `/anything/path1` route. However, it is not applied to the `/anything/path2` path.   

```yaml {hl_lines=[17,18,19,20,21,22]}
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: httpbin-policy
  namespace: httpbin
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: http
    namespace: kgateway-system
  hostnames:
    - TrafficPolicy.example
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /anything/path1
    filters:
      - type: ExtensionRef
        extensionRef:
          group: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy-group.md" >}}
          kind: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}
          name: transformation
    backendRefs:
    - name: httpbin
      port: 8000
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /anything/path2
    backendRefs:
      - name: httpbin
        port: 8000
```

### HTTPRoute rule {#attach-to-rule}

> [!NOTE]
> To use this feature, you must install the Kubernetes Gateway API experimental channel version 1.3.0 or later.

Instead of using the `extensionRef` filter to apply a policy to a specific route, you can attach a {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} to an HTTPRoute rule by using the {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}'s `targetRefs.sectionName` option. 

You can also use this attachment option alongside the `extensionRef` filter. However, policies that are attached via the `extensionRef` filter take precedence over policies that are attached via the `targetRefs.sectionName` option.

The following HTTPRoute defines two HTTPRoute rules that both route traffic to the httpbin app. 
```yaml
kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: httpbin
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: http
    namespace: kgateway-system
  hostnames:
    - TrafficPolicy.example
  rules:
  - name: rule0
    matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /anything/path1
    backendRefs:
    - name: httpbin
      port: 8000
  - name: rule1
    matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /anything/path2
    backendRefs:
      - name: httpbin
        port: 8000
EOF
```

To apply a {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} to a specific HTTPRoute rule (`rule1`), use the {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}'s `targetRefs.sectionName` option as shown in the following example. 

```yaml
kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy-apiversion.md" >}}
kind: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}
metadata:
  name: local-ratelimit
  namespace: kgateway-system
spec:
  targetRefs: 
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: httpbin
    sectionName: rule1
  rateLimit:
    local:
      tokenBucket:
        maxTokens: 1
        tokensPerFill: 1
        fillInterval: 100s
EOF
```

### Gateway {#attach-to-gateway}

Policies can be applied to all HTTPRoutes that the Gateway serves. Gateway-level policies are inherited by all child HTTPRoutes, so you can set defaults once without having to configure each HTTPRoute individually. Route-level policies always take precedence over gateway-level ones. For example, you can set a default request timeout at the gateway level, and override it on a specific HTTPRoute when needed.

To attach a {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} to a Gateway, use the `targetRefs` section in the {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} to reference the Gateway as shown in the following example. 

```yaml
apiVersion: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy-apiversion.md" >}}
kind: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}
metadata:
  name: local-ratelimit
  namespace: kgateway-system
spec:
  targetRefs: 
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: http
  rateLimit:
    local:
      tokenBucket:
        maxTokens: 1
        tokensPerFill: 1
        fillInterval: 100s
```

### Gateway listener {#attach-to-listener}

Instead of applying a {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} to all the routes that the Gateway serves, you can select specific Gateway listeners by using the `targetRefs.sectionName` option. 

The following Gateway resource defines two listeners, an HTTP (`http`) and HTTPS (`https`) listener. 

```yaml
kind: Gateway
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: http
  namespace: kgateway-system
spec:
  gatewayClassName: kgateway
  listeners:
  - name: http
    protocol: HTTP
    port: 8080
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: All
  - name: https
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
        - name: https
          kind: Secret
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: All
```

To apply the policy to only the `https` listener, you specify the listener name in the `spec.targetRefs.sectionName` field in the {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} resource as shown in the following example. 

```yaml
apiVersion: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy-apiversion.md" >}}
kind: {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}
metadata:
  name: local-ratelimit
  namespace: kgateway-system
spec:
  targetRefs: 
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: http
    sectionName: https
  rateLimit:
    local:
      tokenBucket:
        maxTokens: 1
        tokensPerFill: 1
        fillInterval: 100s
```

## Policy priority and merging rules

If you apply multiple {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicies.md" >}} by using different attachment options, policies are merged based on specificity and priority. 

By default, the following rules apply. You can update the behavior by using the `kgateway.dev/inherited-policy-priority` annotation. For more information, see [Policy merging]({{< link-hextra path="/about/policies/merging/" >}}).

* If you apply multiple {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicies.md" >}} that define the same top-level policy, the policies are not merged and only the oldest policy is enforced. Policies with a later timestamp are ignored. 
* {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicies.md" >}} that define different top-level policies are merged and are enforced in combination. 
* In addition to the timestamp, the attachment option of a policy determines the policy priority. In general, more specific policy targets have higher priority and take precedence over less specific policies. For example, a policy targeting an individual route has higher priority than a policy targeting all the routes in an HTTPRoute resource. However, keep in mind that these rules might be different in a route delegation setup. For more information, see [Policy inheritance and overrides in delegation setups](#delegation). 
* Lower priority policies can augment higher priority policies by defining other top-level policies. For example, if you already attached a local rate limiting policy to a Gateway listener by using the `targetRefs.sectionName` option, you can add another {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} that defines a transformation policy and apply that policy to the entire Gateway. 
* Native Kubernetes Gateway API policies have higher priority than any kgateway-native policies that must be attached via the `targetRefs` or `extensionRef` option.

### Priority order

Review the following Gateway and HTTPRoute policy priorities, sorted from highest to lowest.

**Gateway**: 

| Priority | Attachment option | Description | 
| -- | -- | -- | 
| 1 | [Gateway listener policy](#attach-to-listener) | A {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} that references a Gateway listener by using the `targetRefs.sectionName` field has the highest priority. Note that if you have multiple Gateway listener policies that define the same top-level policy, only the one with the oldest timestamp is applied. |
| 2 | [Gateway policy](#attach-to-gateway) | A {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} that references a Gateway in the `targetRefs` section has the lowest priority. This policy can still augment any higher priority policies by defining different top-level policies. Note that if you have multiple Gateway policies that all define the same top-level policy, only the one with the oldest timestamp is applied. |

**HTTPRoute**: 

| Priority | Attachment option | Description | 
| -- | -- | -- | 
| 1 | [Individual HTTPRoute policy](#attach-to-route) | A {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} that is attached to an individual route by using the `extensionRef` filter in the HTTPRoute has the highest priority. Note that if you have multiple HTTPRoute policies that are attached via the `extensionRef` option and all define the same top-level policy, only the one with the oldest timestamp is applied. | 
| 2 | [HTTPRoute rule policy](#attach-to-rule) | A {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} that is attached to an HTTPRoute rule by using the `targetRefs.sectionName` option has a lower priority. This policy can still augment any `extensionRef` policies by defining different top-level policies. Note that if you have multiple HTTPRoute rule policies and all define the same top-level policy, only the one with the oldest timestamp is applied. | 
| 3 | [All HTTPRoute routes policy](#attach-to-all-routes) | A {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} that is attached to all routes in an HTTPRoute resource by using the `targetRefs` option has the lowest priority. You can still augment any higher priority policies by defining different top-level policies. If you have multiple HTTPRoute rule policies and they all specify the same top-level policy, only the one with the oldest timestamp is applied. | 

> [!NOTE]
> Gateway-level {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicies.md" >}} propagate to all child HTTPRoutes. If a child HTTPRoute has its own {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} that defines the same top-level policy, the route-level policy takes precedence and the gateway-level one is ignored for that route. For example, if you set a 60-second request timeout at the gateway level, all HTTPRoutes inherit that timeout unless a route defines its own timeout, which overrides the gateway default.

### Policy inheritance and overrides in delegation setups {#delegation}

The way policies are inherited along the route delegation chain depends on the type of policy that you want to apply. 

#### Native Gateway API policies

{{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/policy-inheritance-native.md" >}}

{{< version exclude-if="2.0.x" >}}For an example, see the policy inheritance guide for [Native Gateway API policies]({{< link-hextra path="/traffic-management/route-delegation/inheritance/native-policies/" >}}).{{< /version >}}

#### Kgateway policies

{{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/policy-inheritance.md" >}}

{{< version exclude-if="2.0.x" >}}For an example, see the policy inheritance guide for [kgateway policies]({{< link-hextra path="/traffic-management/route-delegation/inheritance/kgateway-policies/" >}}).{{< /version >}}
