{{< reuse "/kgw-docs/snippets/kgateway-capital.md" >}} lets you define how policies are merged when they are applied to a parent and child resource. 

## About

Parent-child hierarchies might be:

* Resources that target or serve other resources, such as Gateway > ListenerSet > HTTPRoute > Route rule.
* Routes that are delegated, such as Parent HTTPRoute A > Child HTTPRoute B > Grandchild HTTPRoute C.

Policy merging applies to the following policies:

* Native Kubernetes Gateway API policies, such as rewrites, timeouts, or retries.
* {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}.

Resources that are higher in the parent-child hierarchy can use a special annotation to define how child resources inherit policies. This way, parent resources such as a Gateway or HTTPRoute can decide whether child resources can override the parent policies or not.

{{< version exclude-if="2.1.x,2.2.x,2.3.x,2.4.x" >}}
Policy merging is isolated for each delegation tree. The same delegated HTTPRoute can be reached through multiple parent routes. A merged policy for one parent does not change the policy configuration that another parent or translation cycle reuses.

## Merging annotation {#merging-annotation}

The annotation on the parent resource is: `kgateway.dev/inherited-policy-priority`.

You can use the following values for the annotation:

- `ShallowMergePreferChild` (default): Child policies take precedence over parent policies and the policies are shallow merged.
- `ShallowMergePreferParent`: Parent policies take precedence over child policies and the policies are shallow merged.

> [!WARNING]
> **Authentication and authorization policies can be overridden by delegated child routes.**
>
> With the default `ShallowMergePreferChild` strategy, a delegated child route can override and effectively disable authentication and authorization policies inherited from the parent route. For example, a child route can set `extAuth.disable: {}` or `jwtAuth.disable: {}` in a TrafficPolicy to bypass the ext-authz or JWT authentication that the parent mandates. Because a tenant who owns a delegated child HTTPRoute can create TrafficPolicies in their own namespace without access to the parent route or platform namespace, this bypass requires no elevated permissions beyond the normal delegatee role.
>
> If you are a platform operator who must enforce mandatory authentication or authorization across all delegated routes, set the `kgateway.dev/inherited-policy-priority: ShallowMergePreferParent` annotation on the parent HTTPRoute. This ensures that parent security policies take precedence and cannot be overridden by child routes.

**Shallow merging** means that the policies are merged at the top level. Only the top-level fields of the policies are considered for merging. If a field is present in both parent and child policies, the value from the higher priority policy is used. Priority is typically determined by specificity and creation time. The more specific (such as HTTPRoute rule over all the routes in the HTTPRoute) and older (created-first) policy takes precedence. Consider the following shallow merge scenario:

* Parent policy adds a `x-season=summer` header.
* Child policy adds `x-season=winter` and `x-holiday=christmas` headers.
* Merging annotation is the default value, `ShallowMergePreferChild`.

Resulting merged policy: The parent's `x-season` header is not included in the merged policy because the strategy is `ShallowMergePreferChild`.

| Header | Value | Source |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `x-season` | `winter` | Child |
| `x-holiday` | `christmas` | Child |

<!--TODO deep merge
The annotation takes four values:

- `ShallowMergePreferChild` (default): Child policies take precedence over parent policies and the policies are shallow merged.
- `ShallowMergePreferParent`: Parent policies take precedence over child policies and the policies are shallow merged.
- `DeepMergePreferChild`: Child policies take precedence over parent policies and the policies are deep merged.
- `DeepMergePreferParent`: Parent policies take precedence over child policies and the policies are deep merged.

## Shallow or deep merging {#shallow-deep-merging}

Merging ensures that policies from parent and child resources are combined without conflicts, using either _shallow_ or _deep_ strategies.

**Shallow merging** means that the policies are merged at the top level. Only the top-level fields of the policies are considered for merging. If a field is present in both parent and child policies, the value from the higher priority policy is used. Priority is typically determined by specificity and creation time. The more specific (such as HTTPRoute rule over all the routes in the HTTPRoute) and older (created-first) policy takes precedence. Consider the following shallow merge scenario:

* Parent policy adds a `x-season=summer` header.
* Child policy adds `x-season=winter` and `x-holiday=christmas` headers.
* Merging annotation is the default value, `ShallowMergePreferChild`.

Resulting merged policy: The parent's `x-season` header is not included in the merged policy because the strategy is `ShallowMergePreferChild`.

| Header | Value | Source |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `x-season` | `winter` | Child |
| `x-holiday` | `christmas` | Child |

**Deep merging** means that values from both parent and child policies can be combined. Currently, only [Transformation rules of a {{< reuse "kgw-docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}](../../traffic-management/transformations) can be deep merged. Consider the following deep merge scenario:

* Parent policy adds an `x-season=summer` header.
* Child policy adds `x-season=winter` and `x-holiday=christmas` headers.
* Grandchild policy adds `x-season=spring`, `x-holiday=easter`, `x-discount=10%` headers.
* Merging annotation is `DeepMergePreferParent`.

Resulting merged policy's headers: The child and grandchild values merge with the parent's, with the parent's value ordered first because it takes precedence.

| Header | Value | Source |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `x-season` | `summer,winter,spring` | Parent, Child, Grandchild |
| `x-holiday` | `christmas,easter` | Child, Grandchild |
| `x-discount` | `10%` | Grandchild |
